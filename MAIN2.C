//  MAIN
//  Solves finite element problems.
//
//  In order to measure accurately the time elapsed in the assembly phase
//  (formation of the linear system), this version of function 'main' clearly 
//  separates the input phase (instanciation) from the analysis phase.
//  Here the objects read anticipatively their data in the input file 
//  (using methods 'instanciateYourself()') ; by contrast, in the method 
//  'main' defined in file 'main.c', objects read their data only when 
//  required, so input and analysis phases overlap.
//  You may, or may not, use the compiling option DEBUG.

#include "domain.hxx"
#include "clock.h"
