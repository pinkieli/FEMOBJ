/*
  file COMPILER.DEF

  This file sets some operating system functions and some platform dependent
  programming variables.

  1) CUSTOMIZING TO YOUR PLATFORM :
  --------------------------------
  This package is set up for 2 C++ implementations :
     - Borland C++ (or Turbo C++) for PC
     - AT&T C++ for Silicon Graphics workstation
     - AT&T C++ for Sun workstation.
  If you are using another compiler or another platform, the only thing
  you have to do is to enrich this file accordingly.

  How to set the program for your machine :
  please activate the #define line correposnding to your platform, and
  de-activate all others. For example, if your platform is Borland C++ for
  PC, check below that this setting is on :
	 #define BORLAND
	 //#define SILICON_GRAPHICS
         //#define SUN_STATION
	 //#define OTHER_PLATFORM

  2) PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
  -----------------------
  Switching to the adequate operating system calls for measuring  and
  printing execution times.
