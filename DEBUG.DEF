/*
  file DEBUG.DEF
 
  This file defines the variable DEBUG, which causes the safer (and slower)
  version of the code to be compiled and executed.
  Warning : - if you use function 'main' as defined in file 'main.c', you MUST
            use the DEBUG compiling option ; otherwise you end up with very
            serious execution errors (in methods 'assemble' of classes Skyline
            and FloatArray) ;
            - if you use function 'main' as defined in file 'main2.c', you
            may, or may not, use option DEBUG.
